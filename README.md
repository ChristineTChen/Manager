# CS4550 Project: Manager Web App

### Team: Christine Chen & Rosaline (Ruisi) Su

Github Repo: https://github.com/ChristineTChen/Manager.git
Domain: project.christinetchen.com

The Manager App is a phoenix and reactJs application.

Project Status: Manager app
	Our Manager app relies heavily on the ability to create and view the following resources: tasks, teammates, and calendar shifts. What we’ve completed so far shows proof of our ability to establish the core design of our project. However, we are aware of the minor items that we don’t have; such as letting the database to interfere/select which Google user is allowed to log in. 
	Later in development, we realized it is almost impossible to pass JS variables into Elixir because Elixir is already compiled while JS waits for input. Given the time constraints, we decided to put in effort to set up the essential aspects of our web app. At the end of the project, we were able to show those features are successfully implemented. If we were allowed more time and possibly a bigger team, we would add the additional features to improve the flexibility of our web application. 

Future implementation ideas:
	Over winter break, we would like to add better visibility with user calendar information. For instance, we want to show the events on the user’s calendar as either created from Manager App (from a user’s manager)or pulled from their existing events. The current layout isn’t intuitive besides being ordered by date of occurrence.
	Another ability is to add teams. We currently only have one team rendered on the app. However, we want the ability to show groups and have bulletin boards for each team.
